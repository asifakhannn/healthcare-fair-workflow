# Kaggle Healthcare Dataset – FAIR Reproducible Workflow


This repository analyzes a **Healthcare Dataset** that includes patient-level healthcare data (age, gender, medical conditions, treatment cost, etc.).  
The goal is to show how a simple data science project can be made **FAIR**: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Healthcare Dataset (`healthcare.csv`)  
- **Content:** Patient demographics, admission details, billing amounts, and medical information.  
- **Preprocessing:** Derived features such as `length_of_stay` and `age_bin` were created for analysis.  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)

- **Goal:** demonstrate a clean, reproducible workflow that follows the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

---

##  Environment Setup
All dependencies are defined in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

# 1. Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate healthcare_fair_env

# 2. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/asifakhannn/healthcare-fair-workflow.git
cd healthcare-fair-workflow

## 3. Add dataset
Download from Kaggle and save to dataset/

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset

# 4. Run Jupyter
jupyter lab

---

## Usage Guidelines
- Open the `notebook.ipynb` notebook to start the analysis.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and generate outputs.
- Ensure that the required data files are placed in the `dataset` directory.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several Python packages for data analysis and visualization. These dependencies are specified in the `environment.yml` file. Version pinning is used to ensure compatibility and reproducibility across different environments.


## FAIR Data Principles
This workflow is designed with the FAIR principles in mind:
- **Findable**: The project is hosted on GitHub with clear documentation and metadata.
- **Accessible**: The data is included in the repository and can be easily loaded using the provided functions.
- **Interoperable**: The project uses widely accepted formats (CSV for data, PNG for outputs) and standardizes column names.
- **Reusable**: The code is licensed and includes documentation for context and assumptions, making it easy to adapt for other datasets.

## Reproducibility & Versioning
	•	SemVer: tag releases v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.
	•	Environment pinning: exact versions in environment.yml.
	•	Git: commit history keeps track of changes.

## Version pinning rationale

We pin exact versions to ensure byte-for-byte reproducibility of results. Packages were chosen as the latest stable releases that are mutually compatible with Python 3.11 (e.g., pandas 2.2.2, numpy 1.26.4, matplotlib 3.8.4, scikit-learn 1.4.2).We use the conda-forge channel for consistent builds across platforms.
Pinning avoids “silent” breaks (API changes, new defaults, dependency swaps) that can make the same notebook produce different outputs in the future.

## Risk Assessment
- **Upstream Availability**: Datasets may change or become unavailable. To mitigate this, consider archiving the dataset or including it in the repository Available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset]
- **Package Changes**: Future updates to packages may introduce breaking changes. Version pinning in `environment.yml` helps manage this risk.
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent data can affect results. Basic cleaning and validation steps are included in the workflow to address this issue.
- **Binary/OS differences**: Numerical libs can yield tiny numeric diffs. Use conda-forge builds and keep versions fixed; document OS/CPU in README.
- **Include this quick version-check cell**: (top of the notebook) This proves the environment matches the pinned versions.

import sys, pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib
import sklearn, scipy
print({
    "python": sys.version.split()[0],
    "pandas": pd.__version__,
    "numpy": np.__version__,
    "matplotlib": matplotlib.__version__,
    "scikit_learn": sklearn.__version__,
    "scipy": scipy.__version__,
})
